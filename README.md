# TWNeoP: A Framework for Neoantigen Prioritization
---

TWNeoP is a LightGBM-based framework for prioritizing immunogenic neoantigens in personalized cancer vaccines and infectious disease immunotherapies. It integrates features like binding affinity, hydrophobicity, and sequence homology to predict peptideâ€“MHC (pMHC) immunogenicity. Enhanced by ensemble learning with DeepHLApan and BigMHC scores, TWNeoP is trained on curated datasets (IEDB, PRIME, DeepNeo), achieving an AUC of 0.88 and a positive predictive value of ~0.9 on an independent test set. Case studies on tumor-associated neoantigens and tuberculosis vaccine candidates demonstrate its versatility. Open-source and scalable, TWNeoP streamlines vaccine development and accelerates precision immunotherapy.
